I'll be a reviewer at the [AI-HuSo](https://fedcsis.org/sessions/itbs/ai-huso) Workshop as well as [SKILLS'23](https://www.bibb.de/de/172130.php), which in and of itself might not be very newsworthy, but I thought I'd take the chance to advertise these Workshops. If you are a researcher interested in my content, you might want to take a look at them. CfPs are still open for a while! Both workshops are organized by my colleague Dr. Jens DÃ¶rpinghaus and have a - much needed - interdisciplinary topic focus.
